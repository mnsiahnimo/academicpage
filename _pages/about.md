Statistician with deep expertise in advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and Cloud DevOps/MLOps engineering, with over 7 years of experience building, automating, and deploying data-driven systems in AWS, Azure, and hybrid cloud environments.

My academic foundation lies in applied statistical research, where I developed predictive models and inference pipelines for health sciences, and experimental science. I specialize in generalized linear models, survival analysis, tree-based ensembles, and dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional biological and behavioral data.

Complementing this, I’ve architected and maintained CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, deployed containerized ML models with Docker and ECS, and authored infrastructure-as-code with Terraform and CloudFormation to support secure, scalable, and reproducible production environments.

I bring a unique edge by bridging rigorous statistical science with hands-on cloud engineering — enabling models and algorithms developed in research to scale, deploy, and generate impact in real-world, production-grade systems

Areas of Interests
======
1. High-dimensional data analysis (genomics, behavioral data, clinical outcomes)
2. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for large biological datasets
3. Predictive modeling (regression, classification, survival analysis)
4. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) & mixed-effects models
5. Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
6. Statistical computing

DevOps & Cloud Engineering 
======
1. Cloud Platforms: AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, RDS), Azure
2. CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps Pipelines
3. Containerization: Docker, Amazon ECS
4. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
5. Web/App Deployment: Gunicorn, Nginx, Flask
6. Version Control: Git, GitHub

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
